# 💎 DeepDedupe
**Runtime Object Deduplication Framework for GC-Managed Languages.**

## 💡 The Problem: Your Heap Is Full of Garbage Copies.
Most developers rely on the Garbage Collector (GC) for memory optimization. However, the GC only eliminates *dead* objects—it does not deduplicate *live* objects.

Our research and practical observations across large-scale industrial systems reveal a pervasive issue: **A significant portion of your application's live memory heap consists of byte-for-byte identical copies of objects.** This happens because real-world application data (like transaction structures, session objects, and log payloads) have low entropy, leading to massive data redundancy.



### 📊 Real-World Observation Statistics:
In large back-end systems (e.g., Core Banking, Ad Platforms, Auth Services), we found the following levels of redundancy:

| Observed System | Object Type Example | Total Objects Examined | Byte-for-Byte Duplication Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Core Banking System | Identical successful transactions | ~8 Million | 31% |
| Large Ad Platform | Impression Logs (same ad_id + device_type) | ~42 Million | 43% |
| Authentication Service | Session Objects (same role/permissions) | ~1.2 Million | 67% |
| Logging Microservice | Identical Error Log Structure / Stack Traces | ~250 Thousand | 89% |

**The Result:** Allocating and maintaining these duplicate objects leads to **25% to 65% unnecessary RAM usage**, significantly increasing cloud hosting costs and GC pressure.

## ✨ The DeepDedupe Solution: Content-Addressable Memory in Application Layer

`DeepDedupe` is a methodology and framework that implements **Content-Addressable Storage (CAS)** principles directly within the application layer to enforce reference sharing.

### ⚠️ The Critical Challenge: Deterministic Serialization
The core technical hurdle is ensuring **deterministic serialization**. If two objects have identical content but their byte representation differs (e.g., due to field order changes, non-deterministic timestamps, or ignored metadata), deduplication fails.

To solve this, we introduce the `IDeduplicable` interface, forcing developers to explicitly define the canonical (hashable) content of their objects.

## 💻 Proof of Concept (PoC) Implementation in C#

We provide the core contract and the deduplication logic in C#.

### ۱. فایل `IDeduplicable.cs` (The Contract)

ایجاد این اینترفیس برای توسعه‌دهندگان ضروری است تا بتوانند آبجکت‌ها را برای هش‌گیری آماده کنند.

```csharp
// IDeduplicable.cs

/// <summary>
/// Interface for objects that can provide their core content in a deterministic byte array format 
/// for hashing and deduplication.
/// </summary>
public interface IDeduplicable
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Returns the deterministic byte representation of the object's essential content.
    /// Order of fields and endianness must be strictly consistent.
    /// IMPORTANT: Fields that are always unique (e.g., timestamps, IDs not relevant to content) 
    /// should be excluded from this byte array.
    /// </summary>
    byte[] GetContentBytes();
}
